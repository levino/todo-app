# How Family Todo Works

Family Todo is a task management app for families with a unique approach: **You manage everything through conversations with Claude**, Anthropic's AI. No complicated menus, no settings to search through – just say what you want.

## Who is this app for?

Family Todo is perfect for families who:
- Want to help their children complete daily tasks
- Need a simple overview of household chores
- Don't want to deal with complicated apps

## The Two Views

### 1. The Kiosk View (for Children)

This is what your children see – a simple list of their tasks:

- **View tasks**: Each child only sees their own tasks
- **Check off tasks**: One tap is all it takes to mark a task as done
- **No distractions**: No login, no settings, no ads

You can run the kiosk view on a tablet in the children's room or set it as the homepage on the family computer.

### 2. The Claude View (for Parents)

As a parent, you manage everything through Claude. You'll need:
1. A Claude account at [claude.ai](https://claude.ai)
2. Connect the Family Todo app with your Claude account

Then you can simply tell Claude what you want:

> *"Create a new task 'Clean room' for Lisa"*

> *"Show me all of Max's tasks for today"*

> *"Delete the task 'Take out trash' for Tom"*

> *"Create the task 'Brush teeth' with high priority for all children"*

## What can I do?

### Manage Families

- **Create family**: *"Create a new family called 'Smith'"*
- **View families**: *"Show me my families"*
- **Delete family**: *"Delete the 'Smith' family"*

### Manage Children

- **Add child**: *"Add a child named 'Emma' to the family"*
- **Set avatar**: *"Give Emma a star as her avatar"*
- **Remove child**: *"Remove Max from the family"*

### Manage Tasks

- **Set priority**: *"Make 'Clean room' a top priority for Max"*
- **Delete task**: *"Delete the 'Go shopping' task for Emma"*
- **Reset task**: *"Reset Lisa's 'Brush teeth' task to incomplete"*

### Get Overview

- **All tasks**: *"Show me all tasks for today"*
- **Completed tasks**: *"What has Max accomplished today?"*
- **Open tasks**: *"Which tasks are still open?"*

## Typical Daily Flow
