# Roadmap

Family Todo is actively developed. Here are the planned features.

## Phase 1: Recurring Tasks ⏳

**Status: Planning**

Many tasks repeat daily or weekly. With recurring tasks, these only need to be defined once.

### Planned Features

- **Daily Tasks**: Automatic reset at midnight
- **Weekly Tasks**: Select specific days (e.g., school days only)
- **Automatic Creation**: Tasks appear automatically at the defined time

### Example Interaction

> "Create a daily task 'Brush teeth' for Max that appears every morning"

> "Lisa should have 'Practice piano' as a task every Monday and Wednesday"

---

## Phase 2: Time Periods 🌅

**Status: Planning**

Tasks for specific times of day – Morning, Noon, Evening.

### Concept

```mermaid

    subgraph Morning["🌅 Morning (6:00 AM - 12:00 PM)"]
        M1["☐ Brush teeth"]
        M2["☐ Get dressed"]
        M3["☐ Have breakfast"]
    end

    subgraph Afternoon["☀️ Afternoon (12:00 PM - 6:00 PM)"]
        N1["☐ Do homework"]
        N2["☐ Clean room"]
    end

    subgraph Evening["🌙 Evening (6:00 PM - 10:00 PM)"]
        A1["☐ Help with dinner"]
        A2["☐ Brush teeth"]
        A3["☐ Put on pajamas"]
    end

    Morning --> Afternoon --> Evening
```

### Planned Features

- **Three Time Periods**: Morning, Afternoon, Evening (configurable)
- **Visual Grouping**: Kiosk view shows tasks grouped by time of day
- **Automatic Filtering**: Only relevant tasks for the current time period

### Example Interaction

> "Show me only Max's morning tasks"

> "Add 'Homework' as an afternoon task for Lisa"
